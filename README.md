# 🚀 Image to Text to Audio

A handy mini‑project that takes an image, extracts its text using OCR, and plays it back as speech. Built in Colab with easy steps to upload your own image and hear your text aloud.

## 📁 Repository Contents


This repo includes one mini‑project folder:

- **image-to-audio/** – Accepts an image, extracts its text via Tesseract OCR, generates speech with gTTS, and plays it in the notebook.

---

## 🧩 Getting Started

1. Click into `image-to-audio/`
2. Follow that folder’s `README.md` for setup steps and usage instructions (you’ll find the full Colab-ready code there).
3. Upload your image, run all cells, and hear it speak!

## 🛠️ Project Breakdown

Within **image-to-audio/** you’ll typically find:

- A Colab/Notebook or `.py` file containing:
  - Installation for Tesseract, Python libraries, image upload via Colab
  - OCR extraction (`pytesseract.image_to_string(...)`)
  - Text-to-speech with `gTTS` → MP3
  - Inline audio playback (`IPython.display.Audio`)
- Helpful comments to guide you through each stage

## 🛣️ How to Extend

- Add a UI or accept inputs from Google Drive
- Support multiple languages by changing `lang='xx'` in OCR and TTS
- Integrate other TTS engines (like Silero, Coqui, or OpenAI)
- Wrap the pipeline into a simple Flask web app
